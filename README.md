> Pure-Swift JSON parser & formatter. Fully streamable input and output. Linux &amp; OS X ready. Replacement for NSJSONSerialization.

Jay conforms to the following specifications:
- JSON [RFC4627](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt)

# :question: Why?
We all use JSON. Especially when writing server-side Swift that needs to run on Linux. `#0dependencies`

This is my take on how a JSON parser should work. *This is not another JSON mapping utility library.* This is an actual **JSON parser** and **formatter**. Check out the code, it was fun to write ðŸ˜‡

# Features
- [x] Parsing: data -> JSON object
- [x] Formatting: JSON object -> data
- [x] Pretty printing
- [x] Streaming input and output, low memory footprint

# Usage

## Parsing from data (deserialization)
```swift
do {
	//get data from disk/network
	let data: [UInt8] = ...

	//ask Jay to parse your data
	let json = try Jay().typesafeJsonFromData(data) // JsonValue

	//if it doesn't throw an error, all went well
	if let tasks = json.dictionary?["today"]?.array {
	    //you have a dictionary root object, with an array under the key "today"
	    print(tasks) //["laundry", "cook dinner for gf"]
	} 
} catch {
	print("Parsing error: \(error)")
}
```

## Formatting into data (serialization)
```swift
do {
	//get a json object (works for both [String: Any] and typesafe versions - JsonValue)
	let json: [String: Any] = ... // [String: Any] or [Any] or JsonValue

	//ask Jay to generate data
	let data = try Jay().dataFromJson(json) // [UInt8]

	//send data over network, save to disk
} catch {
	print("Formatting error: \(error)")
}
```

# Installation

## Swift Package Manager

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/czechboy0/Jay.git", majorVersion: 0)
```
## CocoaPods

```
pod 'Jay'
```

## Swift Versions
This project was originally created for a Swift server running on Linux, so it's always built (and assumes) the latest Swift and SwiftPM versions. To manage Swift versions easily, I recommend you use [swiftenv](https://github.com/kylef/swiftenv#installation). You can see which Swift version Jay requires at the moment in the [`.swift-version`](https://github.com/czechboy0/Jay/blob/master/.swift-version) file in the root of the repository. Please make sure you're always running at least that version if you want to use Jay in your project.
